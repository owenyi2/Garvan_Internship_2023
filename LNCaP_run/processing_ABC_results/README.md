data
- GeneList.bed, EnhancerList.bed from ABCv1.0.0/results/Neighborhoods
- PCHi-C_LNCaP_NT_chicago_merge_3Kb.ibed from /share/ScratchGeneral/...

scripts.sh :: 
- annotates PCHi-C set with closest gene to bait-end (within some reasonable threshold e.g. 1500bp) 
- annotates capture end with nearest enhancer (within some reasonable threshold e.g. 1000bp) based on Enhancer List generated by macs2 portion of ABC workflow
- We should expect the bait to overlap with genes more often than the other end to overlap with Enhancers. This is because while PCHi-C guarantees that the bait end corresponds to a promoter, the other end can be anything i.e. not necessarily all enhancers

negative.py ::
- constructs a negative dataset by randomly matching regions from EnhancerList and GeneList

overlap.py
- takes the filtered down dataset from scripts.sh and merges in the ABC scores
